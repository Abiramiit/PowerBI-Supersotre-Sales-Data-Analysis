#PowerBI Superstore Sale Data Analysis:-

This PowerBI is related to Superstore Sales Analysis, for this I used a Sample Superstore dataset that contains product sales information throughout the United States. The dataset contains various customer-related details, including customer names, order and shipment dates, product names, product categories and subcategories, profit made, and so on. This dataset is commonly known as a Sample Superstore dataset. 
 
I have analyzed this dataset by comparing sales and profit from each segment, year, and quarter. I also created a map to show the sales across different states in the USA.
